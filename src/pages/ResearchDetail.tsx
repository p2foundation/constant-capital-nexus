      <h2>Market Summary</h2>
      <p>West African sovereign bond yields showed mixed performance this week with Ghana's yields tightening while Nigerian yields widened slightly. C么te d'Ivoire's bonds remained relatively stable.</p>
      
      <h2>Ghana</h2>
      <p>Ghana's 2025 Eurobond yields compressed by 45bps to 7.25% following the announcement of the IMF's positive review of the country's economic reform program. Local currency treasury yields also declined across the curve with the 91-day bill dropping 15bps to 24.35%.</p>
      
      <h2>Nigeria</h2>
      <p>Nigerian sovereign yields increased by 22bps on average as investors reacted to the latest inflation data, which came in higher than consensus estimates. The 2029 Eurobond now yields 8.75%, up from 8.53% last week.</p>
      
      <h2>C么te d'Ivoire</h2>
      <p>C么te d'Ivoire bonds traded sideways with minimal yield movement. The 2032 Eurobond currently yields 5.62%, marginally lower than last week's 5.65%.</p>
      
      <h2>Investment Strategy</h2>
      <p>We maintain our overweight position on Ghanaian sovereign debt, particularly the mid-duration issues, as we expect continued yield compression supported by improving macroeconomic fundamentals and the successful IMF program implementation.</p>

      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>The Ghana Cedi has demonstrated remarkable stability against major currencies during Q1 2025, appreciating 2.3% against the USD year-to-date. This report examines key drivers of recent performance and provides our outlook for Q2 2025.</p>
      
      <h2>Recent Performance</h2>
      <p>The GHS/USD exchange rate has moved from 15.25 at the beginning of the year to 14.90 as of March 31, 2025. This stability has been supported by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved foreign exchange reserves, currently standing at USD 7.2 billion (3.7 months of import cover)</li>
        <li>Strong cocoa export revenues due to favorable global prices</li>
        <li>Continued disbursements from the IMF Extended Credit Facility</li>
        <li>Proactive monetary policy management by the Bank of Ghana</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Q2 2025 Outlook</h2>
      <p>We project the GHS/USD exchange rate to trade within a range of 14.75-15.10 during Q2 2025. Key factors that will influence performance include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seasonal import demand patterns</li>
        <li>Oil price movements and implications for import bills</li>
        <li>Potential foreign investor interest in local currency debt</li>
        <li>Central bank intervention strategy</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>Despite our stable outlook, several risk factors could drive increased volatility:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unexpected shifts in U.S. Federal Reserve policy</li>
        <li>Widening of Ghana's current account deficit</li>
        <li>Political developments ahead of the 2026 general elections</li>
      </ul>

    author: "Emmanuel Agyei, Chief Economist",
    content: `
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>After peaking at 54.1% in December 2022, Ghana's inflation has been on a steady downward trajectory, reaching 21.3% as of March 2025. This report analyzes the current inflationary environment and provides our outlook for the remainder of 2025.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Drivers</h2>
      <p>The recent moderation in inflation can be attributed to several factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relative stability of the Ghanaian Cedi against major trading currencies</li>
        <li>Improved domestic food production following government agricultural initiatives</li>
        <li>Base effects from the high inflation recorded in 2023-24</li>
        <li>Tight monetary policy stance maintained by the Bank of Ghana</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Inflation Forecast</h2>
      <p>We project headline inflation to continue its downward trend, reaching 15.8% by December 2025. This forecast is based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anticipated stability in global commodity prices</li>
        <li>Continued fiscal consolidation under the IMF program</li>
        <li>Improved domestic food supply chains</li>
        <li>Gradual reduction in monetary policy rate by the Bank of Ghana</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Sectoral Analysis</h2>
      <p>Food inflation is expected to decelerate more quickly than non-food inflation, with projections of 14.2% and 17.1% respectively by year-end. Transport inflation remains vulnerable to global oil price movements and domestic fuel price adjustments.</p>

      <h2>Currency Performance Overview</h2>
      <p>The Ghana Cedi (GHS) has maintained relative stability against major trading currencies in June 2025, with the USD/GHS rate hovering around 15.20-15.35.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Drivers of Stability</h2>

        <li>Continued IMF disbursements supporting FX reserves</li>
        <li>Reduced import demand for non-essential goods</li>
        <li>Improved investor confidence in Ghana's economic program</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Foreign Exchange Reserves</h2>
      <p>Ghana's gross international reserves stand at USD 7.8 billion as of end-May 2025, equivalent to 4.1 months of import cover, the highest level since 2019.</p>
      
      <h2>Outlook and Risks</h2>
